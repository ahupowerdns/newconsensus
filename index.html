“Fat is bad, especially saturated fat, of which you should eat very little,
otherwise you get high cholesterol which leads to clogged arteries and heart
disease.  High cholesterol should be lowered with statin pills.  Transfats
are horrible.  If you eat fat, use vegetable oil, margarine and skim dairy
products.”
</p><p>“People get overweight because they don’t move enough and do eat
too much, and people who don’t lose weight should eat less and exercise
more.  <b>If they fail to lose weight, they should try harder!</b>”

“Also, eat more fruit and vegetables. Carbohydrates are good, especially
whole grains.  Base your diet on them.  Stay away from salt.  We are
suspicious of meat, especially red &amp; processed meat.  Eat fish every
once in a while.  Otherwise, calories are calories.”

			<hr/>
<p>
Over the past decades, the old consensus has been codified by governments and
regulators in “food pyramids”, “healthy plates”, “eat well plates” etc. 
This wisdom has presided over a fourfold increase in diabetes, and an
obesity epidemic.  The common response to this is that the wisdom is fine,
<b>but that people just don’t listen and persist in not following the
message</b>.
</p>			
<p>			
It turns out that people did listen. Over the past decades, our intake of
fat has actually decreased and the amount of time spent in sports schools
has skyrocketed.  <b>So if people have listened, it must be the message that is
wrong!</b>
</p>
<p>			
While the jury is out, a new consensus is appearing on the leading edge of
science and in the ‘blogosphere’.  The virtue of this consensus is that it
leads to rapid weight loss in many overweight people.  In addition, lots of
folks with medical issues see their symptoms resolved or lessened if they
follow the new consensus.  I’ve observed this many many times among close
friends and family now.

			<center><h3>The Newly Developing Consensus</h3></center>
						<hr/>
<p>
By themselves, saturated fat and monounsaturated fat, whether from animal or vegetable
origin, are actually fine.  Industrial transfats are horrible. 
Polyunsaturated vegetable oils are dangerously unstable, and should be
avoided.  Actual butter is to be vastly preferred over margarine, which is a
dangerous product.  We like most fish too.  Eat Real Food, not industrially
processed or “lite” or skim variants.
</p>
<p>		
Carbohydrates are not holy, and specifically wheat and gluten are
questionable. Excess carbs lead to spikes in blood sugar and inflammation. 
<b>It is
this inflammation that leads to heart disease, not “fat clogging
arteries”.</b>
</p>
<p>		
Carbohydrates are especially fattening. Fructose, a component of sugar and
HFCS is highly suspect and implicated in causing diabetes and heart disease. 
Cancer cells need loads of sugar and insulin.  So, <b>stay away from sugar and
reduce carbs drastically</b>.  We have a soft spot for very dark chocolate
though.
</p><p>		
Cholesterol is the stuff of life, don’t fight it with pills.  Statins
“work”, with a lot of dangerous side effects, because they lower
inflammation caused by excess carbs, not because they lower cholesterol.
</p><p>		
While exercise has many benefits, you can’t exercise yourself out of a bad
diet.

			<center><h3>The Newly Developing Consensus</h3></center>
						<hr/>
<p>
Within the new consensus, here are some interesting groups:
<ul>
<li>
The Ketogenic Folks<br/>
These simply drop all carbohydrates, which leads to rapid weight loss for a
lot of people. Dropping all carbs generally leads to the body shifting its
metabolism to burning fat, which helps a lot. Little specific attention to quality of
food. Observe this community on <a
href="http://www.reddit.com/r/keto">reddit</a>.
</li>
<li>
Paleo<br/>
The guiding philosophy here is that anything we haven’t been eating for a
million years is unlikely to work well for us. There is ample evidence that
many paleolithic societies were low carb,  and as they did not have
organized agriculture, ate little dairy. Good intro <a
href="http://robbwolf.com/what-is-the-paleo-diet/">here</a>.
</li>
<li>
Primal<br/>
Primal goes beyond paleo, and encompasses how one should exercise, relax,
sleep, play and deal with stress. Advocates living the good life. Is in some
senses more relaxed than paleo. Full disclosure: I’m very much on board with 
<a href="http://marksdailyapple.com">these folks</a>.
</li>
<li>
“Eat real food”
<br/>
This includes the paleo and primal spheres. Like to speak about Food with a
capital F. “Eat Food not ingredients”. Stress the importance of eating
unadulterated real food, and not chemical products. Well described in "<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/In-Defense-Food-Eaters-Manifesto/dp/0143114964">In
Defense of Food</a>"

<a
href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Banting">William
Banting</a> was a 19th century English undertaker who was “severely
overweight”. A doctor he consulted, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Harvey">William Harvey</a>, had learned in Paris
from a lawyer called <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Anthelme_Brillat-Savarin">Brillat-Savarin</a> that to lose weight, one should drop the carbs. This
was the first time that Banting managed to lose weight, and he publicized
his success in a famous letter, which was translated and shared widely. To
this day, in Swedish “Bantar” means “dieting”.

<p>Ancel Keys (1904 – 2004)</p>
<p>
<img src="AncelKeys.jpg"/></p>
<p>
Originated the theory that dietary fat causes heart disease. Swayed entire
nations with his theories. The popular rhetoric is that he handpicked a few
countries to make his case that consumption of fat was strongly correlated
with heart disease, and that his theories took the world by storm. Denise
Minger <a
href="http://rawfoodsos.com/2011/12/22/the-truth-about-ancel-keys-weve-all-got-it-wrong/">demolished that
story</a>, though. However, what is true is that he is
“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancel_Keys">the founding father</a>” of the fat-is-evil theory. We all love to hate him.

Of the famous Atkins diet. Originally a cardiologist, in the 1960s he
struggled to control his own weight. He chanced upon prior low carb
research, and decided to try it for himself to great success. In 1972 his
book “Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution” came out and became an instant
bestseller.
