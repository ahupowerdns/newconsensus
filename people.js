  Bio: "A former Ironman competitor and long-distance runner, with a biology \
  degree.  Runs the “Mark’s Daily Apple” blog and is the author of a number \
  of books describing the ‘primal’ lifestyle, which ranges from how to sleep \
  to how to barbecue your food.  I admit to being very impressed by Mark.  \
  His research is impeccable, and he manages to provide clarity and balanced \
  reviews of even the most controversial issues.  Makes a living from what \
  he espouses, sells products and books, so has a commercial stake in what \
  he says.  I admire a man that can outrun almost everybody, can cook with\
  the best of them, writes books AND debunks medical literature.  Highly  \
  recommended"

In addition, unlike some more one-track publications, they spend time on the variations between people and their dietary needs. Various readers of this page wrote in to highly recommend the Jaminets and their book, as I had missed them on the first time round.
