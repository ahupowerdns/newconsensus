				<p><h5>Mark Sisson</h5></p>
				<p>
				<img src="MarkSisson.jpg"/>
				</p>
				<p>
				A former Ironman competitor and
				long-distance runner, with a biology degree.
				Runs the “Mark’s Daily Apple” blog and is
				the author of a number of books describing
				the ‘primal’ lifestyle, which ranges from
				how to sleep to how to barbecue your food. I
				admit to being very impressed by Mark. His
				research is impeccable, and he manages to
				provide clarity and balanced reviews of even
				the most controversial issues. Makes a
				living from what he espouses, sells products
				and books, so has a commercial stake in what
				he says. I admire a man that can outrun
				almost everybody, can cook with the best of
				them, writes books AND debunks medical
				literature. Highly recommended.

				<p><h5>Dr John Briffa</h5></p>
				<p>
				<img src="DrBriffa.jpg"/>
				</p>
				<p>
				An actual UK family doctor (physician, GP
				etc) who loves his patients. Fights a brave
				war with UK institutions on their ‘heart
				healthy advice’ doled out by organizations
				beholden to the grain industry. Can be a bit
				wonky at times with posts on ‘grounding’ to
				leak electrons into the beach, but still an
				excellent read. Digs up great research, and
				he must be a godsend to his patients.

				<p><h5>J. Stanton</h5></p>
				<p><img src="jstanton.jpg"/></p>
				<p>
				Author of the Gnoll Credo, a well known
				paleo book. His story “Eat like a predator,
				not like prey” nicely brings together a lot
				of the paleo mindset and what it is based
				on.

				<p><h5>
				Dr Thomas Dayspring / @DrLipid ✚</h5>
				</p>
				<p><img src="DrLipid.jpg"/></p>
				<p>
				A specialist lipidologist. An expert on all
				matters of fat in the blood, perhaps one of
				the best. Believes that carbohydrates cause
				many issues with blood lipids, and standard
				bearer that “high cholesterol” is a nonsense
				diagnosis. Unlike some of the hardcore ‘low
				carbing solves everything’ people, he provides very
				detailed case studies on when what kind of
				medication is needed to treat a patient. Has
				commercial ties to lipid testing industry,
				speaker for big pharma. Still, he’s an
				indispensable authority and a great
				educator.

				<h5>Dr Aseem Malhothra / @DrAseemMalhotra
				✚</h5>
				</p>
				<p><img src="DrAseemMalhotra.jpg"/></p>
				<p>
				Dr Malhothra is a British cardiologist who
				thinks our current epidemic of obesity and
				diabetes (‘Diabesity’) can be prevented.
				Fights the old consensus with frequent
				articles in mainstream newspapers. Author of
				a recent and important paper in the British
				Medical Journal “The dietary advice on added
				sugar needs emergency surgery”

				Yoni Freedhoff / @YoniFreedhoff ✚</h5>
				</p>
				<p><img src="Dr._Freedhoff_bigger.jpg"/></p>
				<p>
				Canadian doctor, assistant professor at
				University of Ottawa, director of a weight
				loss institute. Prolific writer, antagonizes
				the food industry. Became famous when he got
				‘disinvited’ to a food industry event when
				they found out his opinions. Instead, he put
				his presentation on YouTube where it got a
				quarter of a million views. Talks a lot
				about how our environment has become
				‘obesogenic’, and how the food industry
				disingenuously works on keeping us fat. Has
				a broader view on obesity than many hardcore
				low-carbers. A force of good.

<h5>Jimmy Moore / @livinlowcarbman</h5>
</p>
<p><img src="JimmyMoore.jpg"/></p>
<p>
Jimmy is a great personal example of what one can achieve through the “new
consensus”. Runs the prolific Living La Vida Lowcarb podcast, where he
interviews the entire “who’s who” of the new consensus. Was so overweight
that it might have killed him, which actually happened to his brother.
Although he sometimes overstates his own knowledge, and his personal medical
situation may make him a “special case”, one can’t help but admire his
boundless energy. He’s a central point in the new consensus community.

				<h5>Petro Dobromylskyj ✚ (animals)</h5>
				</p>
				<p><img src="PetroDobromylskyj.jpg"/></p>
				<p>
				A veterinarian! Peter is driven by the quest
				for knowledge. Fan of Kwaśniewski’s Optimal
				Diet, which helped him feel a lot younger
				and resolve health issues. Peter trawls
				through large amounts of research, and does
				a fine job debunking folks trying to tease
				‘the old consensus’ out of modern research.
				Opinionated guy, sometimes overstates the
				case, but given how much he cares, that is
				to be understood. Has a gift for seeing
				non-obvious truths, like for example that
				“getting fat is good until you stop”. Feuds
				with Guyenet.
